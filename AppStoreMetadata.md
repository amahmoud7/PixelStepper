## App Review Notes

**HealthKit Usage:**
Pixel Stepper reads step count data from HealthKit to determine the character's energy state (vital/neutral/low), track daily missions, calculate streaks, and award Step Coins. This is the core mechanic of the app - the character's appearance and progression reflect the user's daily movement.

**Live Activity:**
The app uses Live Activities to display the pixel character on the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island. The character animates between 2 frames locally using TimelineView. Live Activity content updates when step count changes significantly (not continuously).

**Step Coins & Cosmetics:**
Step Coins are a virtual currency earned through walking (completing missions, maintaining streaks, hitting milestones). They can only be spent in the in-app Cosmetic Shop on avatar customization items. No real money can purchase Step Coins directly - they are purely earned through activity.

**Demo Instructions:**
1. Launch app and complete onboarding (select gender)
2. Grant HealthKit permission when prompted
3. The home screen shows your pixel avatar with current step count
4. Swipe between Home, Stats, and Profile tabs
5. Home tab: View avatar, streak info, daily missions
6. Stats tab: View weekly history, personal records, phase progress
7. Profile tab: Wardrobe, Cosmetic Shop, settings
8. Walk to see character energy change and missions progress
